Please be sure to request a separate API key for each application that you develop.

Your new key is currently active on our testing sandbox, https://sandbox.evernote.com/, but not on our production service. Because the sandbox is completely isolated from our production environment, you will need to create a new account to do your testing. You can create as many sandbox accounts as you need at https://sandbox.evernote.com/Registration.action, but don't use the sandbox for any critical data, since it's not protected and backed up like our production service.

To use the API key, you'll need to visit our developer site, https://dev.evernote.com/doc/, and download the appropriate API SDK for your platform. The SDKs include our API client code as well as sample code, and the API page also contains links to our API Overview and detailed documentation.

Once you have completed your development, visit https://dev.evernote.com/support/ to request activation of your API key on our production service.

If you have any questions or problems, please don't reply to this email. Instead, visit http://dev.evernote.com/support/
